Verilog BCH encoder/decoder.

This is a Verilog based BCH encoder and decoder for single bit, dual bit, and
3 or more bit error correction. The equations and layout for the encoder
and decoders is taken from "The design of a vhdl based synthesis tool for bch
codecs." by Ernest Jamro.

The decoder/encoder is completely parameterizable. The three main parameters
are:

N - The size of the codeword
K - The size of the data to be encoded
T - The number of bits that can be corrected
B - The actual data size (for B <= K)
OPTION - The type of key equation solver

Also of note:
E - The number of error correcting bits, N - K
M - The degree of the polynomial used, N = 2^M - 1

T == 1 - For T == 1, no key solving step is required.

OPTION == POW3 - This option merges key solving and error finding for T == 2.
This option does not require any extra key solving cycles.

OPTION == SERIAL - Serial Berlekamp–Massey algorithm with inversion.
This option is not supported for pentanomials yet (eg, m=8) as the inverter
lacks pentanomial support. This option takes longer but requires less space
than the parallel option. This option takes T * (M + 2) - 2 cycles to solve
the key equation.

OPTION == PARALLEL - Parallel Berlekamp–Massey algorithm without inversion.
This option supports pentanomials and trinomials in less cycles than the
serial option, but requires more gates. This option takes T * 2 - 1 cycles
to solve the key equation.

Modules:

bch_encode - Performs encoding of input data via a large LFSR. It takes
input for B cycles, and produces output for E+B cycles. The first B cycles
of output are the input data repeated, the next E cycles are the
additional ECC bits.

bch_syndrome - Calculates the syndrome equations. Takes N cycles of input
data and produces the equations on the next cycle.

bch_errors_present - Determines based on syndromes if any errors are present
(Not required for decoding). Currently does not have a clock, but it may
required for large M values as it needs to or together M*(T+1) inputs. This
module can be used to allow several bch_syndrome modules to share bch_key
and bch_error modules or to determine that the error is data free before
allowing bch_key to complete.

bch_key - Key equation solver (sigma). Takes syndrome equations as input and
produces the key equation, as well as the number of bit errors detected. See
OPTION for number of cycles required.

bch_error - Error locator. Takes key equation and generates error locations.
After 2 cycles, it clocks out error bits for B cycles, each cycle representing
an error location.

The code currently compiles under Icarus Verilog and Xilinx Isim. Because
the way the parameterization is handled, simulation is slow, especially
for larger values of M.

TODO:

Support processing multiple databits per clock cycle, ideally 8 (one byte).

Support pentanomials for serial option.

Improve simulation times.

Forney algorithm for error location?
