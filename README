Verilog BCH encoder/decoder.

This is a Verilog based BCH encoder and decoder for single bit, dual bit, and
3 or more bit error correction. The equations and layout for the encoder
and decoders is taken from "The design of a vhdl based synthesis tool for bch
codecs." by Ernest Jamro.

The decoder/encoder is completely parameterizable. The three main parameters
are:

N - The size of the codeword
K - The size of the data to be encoded
T - The number of bits that can be corrected

The number of extra bits generated can be given by subtracting K from N.

Used throughout the code is M, the degree of the polynomial used, "N =
(1 << M) - 1".

The code currently does not support pentanomials (eg, m=8). The Jamro paper
supports m=8 but only through a special case, a more general solution
is desired so that m=12 can also be supported.

The code currently compiles under Icarus Verilog and Xilinx Isim. Because
the way the parameterization is handled, simulation is slow, especially
for larger values of M.

TODO:

Support encoding/decoding an abrirary value for K (padded data) and N (padded
codewords).

Support processing multiple databits per clock cycle, ideally 8 (one byte).

Support pentanomials.

Make code easier to integrate into designs, start/done signal?

Improve simulation times.
